The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string 
where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string,
or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

CODE

def duplicate_encode(word):
    #your code here
    word = word.lower()   #ignoring the capitalization case
    list = []
    for i in word:
        if word.count(i) == 1  :  #checking and replacing for unique values
            list.append('(')
        else:
            list.append(')')     #checking and replacing for duplicate values
    return ''.join(list)
